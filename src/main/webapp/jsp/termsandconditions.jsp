<p><h3>Congratulations!</h3></p>
 
<p><strong>You increased the value of your equipment with AgGuard coverage!</strong></p>
 
<p>Your dealer and Ag Guard chose each other because of our mutual desire to provide you with peace of mind and to give you <strong><em>a tool to protect your investment. </em></strong>Machines break and they tend to break at the worst times. If that happens to you, we hope this product will allow you to get back to work quickly and with minimal financial impact. We have found if you sell or trade your machine with coverage remaining, then you will likely recoup the cost of this Contract in the transaction because of the value the market places on the coverage.</p>
 
<p><strong>WHY is the Equipment Service Contract (Terms and Conditions) so detailed?</strong></p>
 
<p>We tried hard to simplify the Contract but we discovered that in order to write in plain English and make the terms clear we actually needed our Contract to be longer and more detailed.</p>
 
<p>Our chief concern is that you might think the Contract covers something it does not. Therefore, we try to include as much detail and to cover as many of the situations we have encountered over the years as possible. We also have the most customer friendly buyer's remorse clause in the business, just in case you change your mind. Bottom line: <strong>we want you to be happy with our product. </strong>To fully understand your coverage, you must read the entire Contract. However, below is a synopsis:</p>
<p><strong><u>POWERTRAIN</u></strong> covers components that produce, transmit or control engine horsepower for propelling the machine along the ground, (e.g., engine, engine electronic controls/sensors, turbo, water pump, fuel injection, drive-line couplers/shafts, U- joints, transfer gears, differential, transmission, final drives, axles, hydro, creeper, PTO, etc.). Combine &amp; Forage harvesters &ndash; Also includes rotor drive gearcase, cylinder drive gearcase, reverser gearcase and all parts contained within these components.</p>
 
<p><strong><u>POWERTRAIN + HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS</u></strong> includes Powertrain coverage plus hydraulic systems, parts and components associated with steering and implement control, (e.g. pumps, coolers, motors, controls, valves, cylinders, accumulators, metal<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">/</span>lines, filter bases, etc.)</p>
 
<p><strong><u>POWERTRAIN + HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS + PLATFORM</u></strong> includes Powertrain + Hydraulic Systems coverage plus additional mechanical, electrical, hi-tech systems, such as cab &amp; front axle suspension, auto steer, and self-leveling systems and structural components. Some call this "full machine", but we think that is misleading. It doesn't cover everything; however, it is intended to be similar to the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p>Note: Individual Hi-tech systems may be purchased with Powertrain and Hydraulic Systems coverage at an additional charge &ndash; Please contact Ag Guard for pricing.</p>
 
<p><strong>GENERAL ITEMS COVERED BY ALL CATEGORIES: </strong>replacement of fluids in conjunction with a covered repair, reasonable diagnostic charges and the replacement of wear items damaged by a failure.</p>
 
<p><strong>WHAT IS NOT COVERED: </strong>Our coverage begins were your warranty and other coverage ends. We don't cover failure due to wear, wear items or maintenance items, (e.g., clutch, belts, brakes, batteries, tires, tracks, bogie wheels, freeze plugs, radiator hoses, rubber hoses/lines, shocks, ground-engaging tools, rattles, handles, bed liners, upholstery, glass, paint, bulbs, seats, tune-ups, etc.). We don&rsquo;t cover systems and appliances not factory installed, expenses arising from the equipment not being available for use, core charges or adjustments, transportation, storage, freight charges, EPA charges, taxes, failure caused you by misuse/abuse/negligence, damage caused by any external cause, contamination/overheating/oil viscosity/sludge/salt/chemicals/rust, parts subject to a recall, Epidemic Failure, continued operation and failure to protect the equipment from further damage.</p>

 &nbsp;
<p><center><h4>KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS</h4></center></p>
 
<p><strong>CONTRACT: </strong>: means this EQUIPMENT SERVICE CONTRACT. It is a CONTRACT between YOU and US.</p>
 
<p><strong>WE, US, OUR: </strong>means the entities issuing this CONTRACT, i.e., the DEALER and GUARANTOR.</p>
 
<p><strong>YOU, YOUR, CONTRACT HOLDER: </strong>means the owner of the EQUIPMENT described in the Equipment Description section above.</p>
 
<p><strong>ADMINISTRATOR: </strong>means the entity appointed by US to administer this CONTRACT. The ADMINISTRATOR has no liability to YOU. The initial ADMINISTRATOR of this Contract is Wild Jay, Inc., but WE, at our sole discretion, may appoint another entity to act in the capacity of ADMINISTRATOR.</p>
 
<p><strong>GUARANTOR: </strong>means Wild Jay, Inc., which is the entity that guarantees payment to YOU of all OUR financial obligations under this CONTRACT. Wild Jay, Inc. reserves funds significantly in excess of OUR actuarial projections for claims based on an analysis of a rolling-eight year experience period. Wild Jay, Inc. has an ownership interest in AgGuard LLC and AgGuard LLC owns equity in Wild Jay, Inc. as a way of ensuring the two entity's customer service goals are aligned.</p>
 
<p><strong>DEALER: </strong>means the Equipment Dealership or Manufacturer selling the MACHINE to the CONTRACT HOLDER. Typically, the DEALER will also provide ongoing service and the repair work associated with a CLAIM; however, this is not required. The ADMINISTRATOR may allow any service provider authorized by the MANUFACTURER to perform such work; however, the CONTRACT HOLDER should verify this before any work is performed.</p>
 
<p><strong>EQUIPMENT/MACHINE: </strong>means the EQUIPMENT described above which is to be used to perform work as part of an enterprise used in crop production, and not used as a vehicle, i.e., not used solely for transportation, or used in construction type applications, such as mining, road building or scraper application. &nbsp;The <strong>MANUFACTURER </strong>is the original Manufacturer of the EQUIPMENT who assigns the <strong>MODEL </strong>and <strong>SERIAL NUMBER </strong>(SERIAL #).</p>
 
<p><strong>MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN or FAILURE</strong>: means the actual breaking or electronic failure of any covered part of the covered MACHINE while in ordinary use arising from to <strong>faults, attributable to manufacturing defects in workmanship or materials</strong> in such MACHINE causing sudden stoppage of the functions thereof and necessitating repair before it can resume work.</p>
 
<p><strong>DEDUCTIBLE</strong>: for each unrelated MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN or FAILURE, YOU will be responsible for the DEDUCTIBLE amount as shown in the Coverage section above and for any other costs not covered by this CONTRACT.</p>
 
<p><strong>CLAIM</strong>: means a formal request to US asking for a payment based on the terms of this CONTRACT. CLAIMS must be presented to US using the methods described in the Claims Process section below. CLAIMS are reviewed by the ADMINISTRATOR or its agent for validity and then paid to the repair facility by the Guarantor. (See the "Claims Process" section below.)</p>
 
<p><strong>Contract Inception Date: </strong>means the date shown in the Coverage section above that establishes when coverage under this EQUIPMENT SERVICE CONTRACT begins. The <strong>Expiration Date </strong>is the date the Contract period ends unless the MACHINE reaches the total allowed Hours first.<strong> The date the Manufacturer's warranty ends </strong>is specified by the MANUFACTURER and verified by the DEALER.</p>
 
<p><strong>CONTRACT PRICE</strong>: means the entire amount in U.S. Dollars paid by YOU to the DEALER for the CONTRACT.</p>
 
<p><strong>HOURS ON MACHINE: </strong>Means the Hours shown on the MACHINE's Hours meter or service meter, or a reasonable estimate which can be documented to the satisfaction of the ADMINISTRATOR.</p>
 
<p><strong>APPLICATION: </strong>Means the primary task for which the MACHINE will be used, (i.e. crop production, livestock production, dairy, landscaping, orchard, mowing, lumber, snow, construction, or other specified Application)</p>
 
<p><strong>COVERED PARTS: </strong>Means any part of the MACHINE listed in the CONTRACT as a COVERED PART and not excluded from coverage by the CONTRACT. (See the "Covered Parts" section below.)</p>
 

<p><strong>LIMITS OF LIABILITY: </strong>The Limit of Liability shall be restricted to the reasonable price for repair or replacement of any Covered Part; not to exceed 50% 0f the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the Equipment, or such lower Limit of Liability as stated in the Coverage section above. The "reasonable price" for repair or replacement is based upon nationally recognized flat rate and/or factory manuals. Labor reimbursement will be based on the Dealer's suggested list price for shop labor. This Contract will only allow for a difference of three (3) dollars between different labor classifications as they are related to the Dealer's suggested list price for shop labor. The necessary replacement and/or repairs must be made with parts of like kind and quality, when available. If any parts are found to be unprocurable, the maximum liability shall be limited to the retail price for the costs associated with the necessary repairs to return the unit to an efficient operating condition as if the repair parts were available to the repairing service facility. Unlike some extended service contracts, there is <u>not</u> a limit of liability per Mechanical Breakdown or Failure under this Contract-a featured sometimes referred to as a "stop-loss" provision.</p>
 
<p>The intent of this Contract is not to restore the Machine to a like-new condition, but rather to restore the Machine to its operating condition just prior to the covered Mechanical Breakdown or Failure. All repairs must be performed by an authorized repair facility. <strong>The repair facility that performs the repairs must warranty its work to be free of defects in material or poor workmanship for a period of no less than six (6) months or 1,000 hours, starting from the date that the Machine is put back into service.</strong></p>
 
<p>Why is the Limit of Liability less than the purchase price the Machine? WE reserve funds for the payment of Claims based on the Limit of Liability; by keeping that number low, but still high enough to cover 99% of Claims (based on our historical experience and actuarial projections), WE can greatly reduce the cost of the Contract for YOU, while still covering almost every claim.</p>
 
<p><strong><u>CONTRACT </u></strong><strong><u>RESPONSIBILITIES, &nbsp;LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS</u></strong> <strong>OUR RESPONSIBILITIES:</strong></p>
<p>WE agree to repair or replace any of the Covered Parts, if required due to a Mechanical Breakdown or Failure;</p>
<p>when the Mechanical Breakdown or Failure is deemed to be covered under this Contract. Following YOUR payment of any applicable Deductible, WE will pay the following costs arising from a Mechanical Breakdown of the Covered Parts occurring during the term of this Contract:</p>
 
<ol>
<li>WE will pay for repair or replacement of the Covered Parts causing the Failure and any components that are rendered unserviceable as a direct result of the Failure.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="2">
<li>WE will pay for lubricants, fluids, filters, hoses, belts, gaskets, seals or other consumables that are rendered unusable as a direct result of the Failure or the necessary repair procedure.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="3">
<li>WE will pay only for new or remanufactured replacement parts made or recommended by the manufacturer of the Machine</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="4">
<li>WE will pay labor costs at the hourly rate charged by the Dealer during normal operating hours. If YOU choose to have the repair performed outside the Dealer's normal operating hours, YOU will be responsible for any excess labor expenses due to overtime or emergency service rates.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="5">
<li>WE will pay for reinstallation, but not for replacement of undamaged components that are removed during the repair procedure. YOU may choose to have such undamaged components replaced at YOUR own expense.</li>
</ol>
 
<p><strong>YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES: &nbsp;</strong>To keep this Contract valid, YOU must:</p>
 
<ol>
<li>Service YOUR Equipment as recommended by the Manufacturer.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="2">
<li>Provide reasonable proof to the Administrator that required service was performed when submitting a Claim. Such proof should include the date and the service-meter Hours of the Equipment at the time of service. Failure to provide proof of service may terminate the Contract and result in the denial of the Claim.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="3">
<li>Upon customary and reasonable notice of the occurrence of a Mechanical Breakdown or Failure, YOU shall protect the Equipment from further damage, whether or not such Mechanical Breakdown or Failure is covered by this Contract. Any operation of the Equipment that results in further damage, related to the original Mechanical Breakdown or Failure, shall be considered YOUR failure to protect the Equipment and shall not be covered under this Contract.</li>
</ol>

 
<ol start="4">
<li>Upon submission of a Claim, the repairing Dealer or YOU must provide all of the required information WE request. In addition, YOU must provide a detailed analysis of the Failure that describes: </li>


<p> 
<ol type="a">
<li><u>Situation</u>: <strong>When </strong>the Machine failed, <strong>where </strong>the Equipment was located and <strong>how </strong>the Failure (<em>For example: On June 22, 2012, on flat, dry ground while planting, the hydraulics would not respond.)</em></li>

 

<li><u>Cause</u>: <strong>Why </strong>the Failure occurred and <strong>what </strong>failed, if known. Identify the specific manufacturing defect. Avoid oversimplifications, such as "failed" or "leaked," without an explanation of what caused the Failure and why the Failure should be covered. If the cause cannot be determined, indicate this and provide information proving the Machine was properly maintained and used as designed. (<em>For example: the hydraulics failed because of a bad main seal causing instant loss of pressure.)</em></li>

 

<li><u>Recommendation for repair</u>: In addition to describing the strategy for repair, this should also include a repair estimate detailing parts and prices along with the estimated labor and rates. If possible, photos should be attached showing the Failure and any affected parts.</li>

 

<li><u>How could this Failure have been avoided</u>: Rule out any service bulletins, field bulletins, recalls, programs, etc. related to the component and group. By better understanding the Failure, a repair can be made that is efficient, effective and will not lead to a repeat Failure. This feedback is also valuable, because WE want to help develop best practices for the repair and give advice to manufactures on product reliability. <em>(For example: The seal does not appear to be sturdy enough for the operating pressures that are typical with this pump. It is unlikely that the owner or any service could have prevented this Failure. The pump needs better seals. No bulletins or recalls address this issue.)</em></li>

</ol>
</ol>
</p> 
<ol start="5">
<li>Substantiation is the best way to avoid disputes. Provide robust information about the Claim. The following are typical examples of information that should be included with a Claim or pre-authorization request:</li>


 
<ol type="a">
<li>Invoice with itemized parts and labor;</li>
<li>Copy of any parts invoice over $500 or involving a core deposit;</li>

<li>Diagrams from a parts book and identification of Failed parts/components;</li>

<li>Manufacturer's flat rate or time estimate for repair;</li>

<li>Photos of the Machine, any involved filter (showing ID and any other markings), and detailed photos indicating how the Failure occurred and what parts were affected. (Photos should be attached to Claim as a .jpg file);</li>

<li>Any other documentation, evidence or descriptions that support the Claim.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
 
<ol start="6">
<li>The Administrator must be notified of any proposed alterations or additions to the Equipment and of any proposed departure from ordinary working conditions for which the Machine was designed. If any such modifications are made/or if the maximum current or maximum pressure for which the Equipment is designed to operate is altered, or any lower maximum as stipulated by the Manufacturer in writing is exceeded without the written consent of the Administrator, then, in the event of Mechanical Breakdown or Failure, no coverage shall exist. If the Administrator cannot approve the proposed modification, then the Coverage may be eligible for cancelation.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>Covered Parts AND Components: <em>(Inclusions)</em></p>
<p>The Coverage YOU selected is identified in the Coverage section above. The components WE cover are separated into three distinct groups for which YOU can request coverage. These groups are described as: Powertrain, Hydraulic Systems and Platform.</p>
 
<p>YOU must purchase Powertrain coverage, but YOU have a choice of adding Hydraulic Systems. YOU may then also add Platform, which will give you the highest level of coverage.</p>
 
<p>Each category builds on the previous category to include more Covered Parts. WE no longer use the terminology "full machine" because WE feel this description is misleading. Much like the Manufacturer's initial warranty, there are a number of parts that are not covered. However, by adding Platform coverage you are typically extended the Coverage on all of the parts covered under the Manufacturer's warranty. Below is a more precise description of the parts and components covered by each category of coverage:</p>

<p><strong><u>Dispute Resolution Process</u></strong></p>
 
<p>In the event of any dispute concerning the interpretation of the Contract or OUR performance, WE recommend that you consider the following actions, in order, prior to requesting arbitration.</p>
 
<ol>
<li>Contact the Chief Relationship Officer or the Director of Sales at AgGuard</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="2">
<li>Contact the Guarantor, Wild Jay, Inc.</li>
</ol>
 

 
<ol start="3">
<li>Request that Wild Jay, Inc. present YOUR dispute to the Dealer Review Panel (a panel of equipment dealers who have no stake in the dispute and can provide rational perspective)</li>
</ol>
 
 
<p>Reasonable people can disagree. This provision is intended to create an efficient and cost effective way of resolving disputes reasonably and respectfully. <u>WE will admit when WE are wrong, say WE are sorry and then do what WE</u> <u>can to make things right.</u></p>
 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION:</strong></p>
<p>YOU must first request arbitration from US in writing within sixty (60) days after YOU receive written notice that the dispute cannot be resolved. For Claims arbitration, written demand must be made to US within sixty (60) days of the denial of a Claim. All arbitration proceedings must be held in or near Kansas City unless another venue is agreed upon by all parties. YOU agree that all individual, class action, or other claims arising from or relating to this Contract, whether in contract, tort, pursuant to statute, regulation, ordinance or in equity or otherwise, are subject, at</p>
<p>YOUR, the Dealer's, or the Guarantor's election, to neutral binding arbitration by The American Arbitration Association under the applicable AAA rules then in effect as modified by this Arbitration Provision. This includes, but is not limited to, Claims asserted by YOU against the Dealer, Guarantor, AgGuard LLC, their affiliates, and/or their and their affiliates' employees, officers, successors, or assigns. Any arbitration hereunder shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. : 1 et seq.) and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The Arbitrator shall follow applicable statutes of limitations, shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law, and, if timely requested by either party, shall provide a brief written explanation of the award's basis. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney, expert, or other fees unless applicable law provides otherwise. Any Claim or dispute is to be arbitrated on an individual basis and not as a class action. YOU expressly waive any right to arbitrate a class action or in a</p>
<p>private attorney general capacity, and there shall be no joinder or consolidation of parties, except for parties to the same Contract. In the event of a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and any other applicable arbitration provision, the other provision's terms shall apply; provided however, that this Arbitration Provision's prohibition on classwide arbitration shall apply. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the other provisions or the Contract; provided however, that if the provision prohibiting classwide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire Arbitration Provision shall be null and void. This Arbitration Provision shall not apply to any individual claim brought by YOU in small claims court, unless such claim is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. Neither YOU, the Dealer, the Guarantor nor AgGuard LLC will have the right to have a jury trial on any Claim for which arbitration is elected. Discovery and rights to appeal are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights applicable in court may not be available in arbitration. This Arbitration Provision will survive any termination, payoff, or transfer of this Service Contract. Information regarding AAA and its procedures for filing a Claim can be found at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org.</a></p>
 
<p><strong>SUBROGATION</strong></p>
 
<p>YOU agree that WE, after honoring a Claim on YOUR Contract, have all rights of subrogation against those who may be responsible for YOUR Mechanical Breakdown or Failure. YOU shall do whatever is necessary to secure such rights on OUR behalf. YOU shall do nothing to prejudice such rights and YOU shall execute and deliver to US instruments and papers required to either secure or maintain such rights. All amounts recovered by YOU, for which YOU were previously reimbursed under this Contract, shall become OUR property or the property of OUR designee and shall be forwarded to same by YOU, up to the total amount paid by US under this Contract. OUR subrogation rights become effective after YOU are made whole.</p>
 
<p><strong>TRANSFER OF THIS CONTRACT</strong></p>
 
<p>WE believe that this Contract adds value to YOUR Equipment and should enhance the value of the Machine when sold or traded. Therefore, WE encourage the transfer of the Contract to new owners; however, to transfer the Contract YOU must contact US and submit the following:</p>
 
 <ul>
<li>Written evidence verifying all maintenance requirements have been met, (e.g., service logs or a certification from the Dealer)</li>
 
 
<li>Documentation evidencing the change of ownership and service Hours at date of sale. (e.g., the title or notarized bill of sale)</li>
 
<li>Proof that the Manufacturer has been notified of the transfer of the factory warranty, if applicable</li>
 
<li>This Contract cannot be transferred to a different Machine<em>. (However, YOU may be able to exchange this</em></li>
<li><em>Contract for a new, discounted Contract.) </em>This Contract can only be transferred to a different owner. The Equipment is subject to inspection and diagnostic testing.</li>
<li>Transfer must take place within fifteen (15) days of a change of ownership, unless WE expressly allow an extension of time.</li>
 
<li>All remaining warranties on the Machine must also be transferred to the new owner. Failure to notify the Administrator of the transfer will void the remaining Contract period.</li>
<li>There is a nominal $50 charge for transferring the Contract to be paid to the Dealer. A new Contract will be prepared and delivered to the new owner and that new Contract will replace and supersede this Contract.</li	>
 
<li>This Contract will be binding upon and enure to the benefit of YOUR heirs, executors, administrators, successors</li>
<li>and permitted assigns.</li>
 </ul>
<p><strong>GENERAL:</strong></p>
 
<ol>
<li>The terms and conditions outlined above are the full and complete agreement between the parties.</li>
<p><strong><em>No oral representation or statement should be relied upon by any party to this Contract.</em></strong></p>
</ol>

 
<ol start="2">
<li>If any provision of this Contract is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the parties' intention. All remaining provisions of this Contract shall remain in full force and effect.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="3">
<li>If any of the Terms or Coverage in this Contract is not clear to YOU, or if YOU discover that the Terms and Coverage do not match with what YOU thought YOU purchased from the Dealer, please contact the Dealer or the Administrator. Hopefully WE can clarify the Terms for YOU or modify the Coverage to meet your needs. However, if you remain unsatisfied, you have up to 90 days to cancel this Contract (see the section titled "Cancellation" above). Only YOU can truly determine if this Contract is a good value and WE want YOU to be satisfied that it does.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="4">
<li>This Contract will be governed by the laws of the state of Kansas. However, WE will abide by consumer protection rules of the state of the Contract Holder or the Dealer if they provide a greater level of consumer protection.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="5">
<li>WE may delegate the performance of OUR duties and obligations and assign OUR rights and benefits hereunder. No amendment, supplement, or waiver of any provision of this Contract will be binding against US unless it is in writing and signed by US.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="6">
<li>Failure by US to require performance of any provision of this Contract shall not affect OUR right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Contract constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="7">
<li>WE may elect to pay a Claim for which WE are not contractually obligated if WE deem there are special circumstances that make enforcement of the terms of the Contract inappropriate or unduly burdensome on YOU. Such decisions are made at OUR sole discretion and do not represent a constructive change to this Contract. Such Claims will be paid from a special reserve account so as not to affect OUR actuarial analysis. For example, we waived the cancelation and subrogation provisions for equipment lost during Hurricane Katrina and either returned the purchase price or applied it to contracts on replacement equipment. We do not want this Contract to ever prevent US from doing "what is right" for our customers.</li>
</ol>
 
<p><strong>PAYMENTS:</strong></p>
<p>WE will pay the repair facility for authorized repairs covered under this Contract. If a repair facility charges YOU directly for repairs that may have otherwise been covered under this Contract, YOU may submit copies of all</p>

 
<p>invoices and receipts pertaining to the repairs along with a copy of page 1 of this Contract and a letter requesting WE pay for the repair. Send your request by mail to the Administrator.</p>
<p><strong><center>"We measure the time to process and make Claims payments in hours, not in days!" THE CLAIMS PROCESS:</center></strong></p>
<p>WE have attempted to keep the Claims handling process as simple as possible. The initial decision as to whether or</p>
<p>not a Mechanical Breakdown is a covered Failure is made by the service or warranty manager of the Dealership or repair facility.</p>
 
 
<p>It is <strong>YOUR </strong>responsibility to protect the Equipment from further damage,</p>
 
<p>It is <strong>YOUR </strong>responsibility to notify the Administrator before starting any repairs</p>
 
 
<p>It is then <strong>YOUR </strong>responsibility to file the claim with the Administrator</p>
 
<p><strong>Step1 <em>(Obtain authorization to start the repair): </em></strong>If the Failure is deemed to be a covered by the Contract, the repair facility should submit a repair estimate via the AgGuard website (<a href="http://www.agguard.com/claims"><strong>www.agguard.com/claims</strong>).</a> The repair estimate should be filed with AgGuard within 90 days of Failure. If the repair estimate is over one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) or if diagnostic cost is over ($500) then the repair facility must contact AgGuard before proceeding with the repair-unless a higher amount for that repair facility has been agreed to and authorized by AgGuard in writing. Failure to pre-notify US could disqualify the Claim.</p>
 
 
<p>YOU must authorize any work on the Machine; therefore, all repair options and considerations should be presented to YOU, no matter what the estimated cost, before any work is done. If We authorize a repair, you must also authorize the repair before the facility begins work. After all, it is your Machine.</p>
 
<p><strong>Step2:<em>(Submit the Claim): </em></strong>The section below "How to Make a Claim" provides specific directions on how to successfully submit a claim and receive quick resolution.</p>
 
<p><strong>Step3: <em>(Get Paid): </em></strong>Upon receipt, OUR staff will carefully review the Claim. If there are no apparent discrepancies, questions, or missing information, a member of the claims staff will determine that:</p>
 
<ol>
<li>The Machine is covered, that it has been properly reported and WE have received payment for the Contract</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="2">
<li>The loss occurred after the expiration of the Manufacturer's Warranty (or any other coverage) and before the expiration of the Contract</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="3">
<li>The loss amount is less than the limit of liability</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="4">
<li>The appropriate repair strategy was followed and cost for parts and labor is reasonable</li>
</ol>
 
<ol start="5">
<li>Coverage will then be determined based on the terms, conditions and exclusions of the Contract</li>
</ol>
 
<p>If the Claim is authorized, then a check is issued to the repair facility less any items that are not covered (e.g., overtime, labor costs, travel, mileage, freight, etc.). If there is an issue, we work to resolve it as soon as possible and provide clear communication to you and the repair facility about the status of the claim.</p>
 
<p><strong>HOW TO MAKE A CLAIM:</strong></p>
<p>When repairs are required, YOU or the repair facility must contact the Administrator to receive instructions. If YOU or the repair facility does not follow the Administrator's instructions, WE may not be obligated to reimburse YOU for the cost of any repairs.</p>
 
<p>Authorization must be obtained from the Administrator prior to having YOUR Machine repaired.<em>(If you were paying for the repair, you would want the opportunity to authorize any repairs or any significant change to the estimated repair cost before work started-we are no different.) </em>Unless WE have entered into a special agreement with a repair facility any repair over $1,500 must be preauthorized. WE reserve the right to inspect any Machine before authorization of any repairs.</p>
 
 
 
<p>YOU may be required to supply the Administrator with all maintenance records for service performed on the Equipment along with photographs, the results of diagnostic tests and any samples WE may reasonably request that will help US to better understand the nature of the Failure.</p>
 
<p>In the event of an emergency situation and the Administrator cannot be reached, YOU can proceed with repairs, but payment will be in accordance with the other provisions of this Contract.</p>
 
<p>If the cost of repair is greater than $1,500, then YOU or the repair facility must, if requested, provide the Administrator with adequate photographic evidence of the affected parts, or preserve the parts affected and make them available for inspection by the Administrator or its agent.</p>
 
<p>When requesting authorization to begin work or submitting the Claim on the Ag Guard website ( <a href="http://www.agguard.com/claims)"><strong>www.agguard.com/claims</strong>)</a> YOU must provide all of the required information WE request. In addition, YOU must provide a detailed analysis of the Failure that describes:</p>
 
<p><strong><u>Situation</u></strong><u>:</u> When the Machine failed, <strong>where </strong>the Equipment was located and <strong>how </strong>the Failure occurred. (<em>For example: On June 22, 2012, on flat, dry ground while planting, the hydraulics would not respond.)</em></p>
 
<p><strong><u>Cause</u></strong>: Why the Failure occurred and <strong>what </strong>failed, if known. <strong>Identify the specific manufacturing defect</strong>. Avoid oversimplifications, such as "failed" or "leaked," without an explanation of what caused the Failure and why the Failure should be covered. If the cause cannot be determined, indicate this and provide information proving the Machine was properly maintained and used as designed. (<em>For example: the hydraulics failed because of a bad main seal causing instant loss of pressure.)</em></p>
 
<p><strong><u>Recommendation for repair</u></strong>:</p>
<p>In addition to describing the strategy for repair, this should also include a repair estimate detailing parts and prices</p>
<p>along with the estimated labor and rates. If possible, photos should be attached showing the Failure and any affected parts.</p>
 
<p><strong><u>How could this Failure have been avoided</u></strong>:</p>
<p>Rule out any service bulletins, field bulletins, recalls, programs, etc. related to the component and group. By better understanding the Failure, a repair can be made that is efficient, effective and will not lead to a repeat Failure. This feedback is also valuable, because WE want to help develop best practices for the repair and give advice to manufactures on product reliability. <em>(For example: The seal does not appear to be sturdy enough for the operating pressures that are typical with this pump. It is unlikely that the owner or any service could have prevented this Failure. The pump needs better seals. No bulletins or recalls address this issue.)</em></p>
 
<p>Substantiation is the best way to avoid disputes. Provide robust information about the Claim. The following are typical examples of information that should be included with a Claim or pre-authorization request:</p>
 
<p>Invoice with itemized parts and labor;</p>
 
<p>Copy of any parts invoice over $500 or involving a core deposit;</p>
 
<p>Diagrams from a parts book and identification of Failed parts/components; Manufacturer's flat rate or time estimate for repair;</p>
<p>Photos of the Machine, any involved filter (showing ID and any other markings), and detailed photos indicating how the Failure occurred and what parts were affected. (Photos should be attached to Claim as a .jpg file);</p>
 
<p>Any other documentation, evidence or descriptions that support the Claim.</p>
 
<p><strong><u>Labor Charges</u></strong></p>
 
<p>We pay overtime at standard time rates only.</p>
 
<p>An explanation of labor rate and hours charged on the repair invoice will expedite the Claim.</p>
 
<p>We adjust labor in accordance with the Manufacturer's time requirement guidelines. If the Claim being filed is more than the Manufacturer's time guide, please provide an explanation for the extra time. This allows our claims administrators to consider exceptions.</p>
 
<p><strong><u>Pictures</u></strong></p>
 
<p>Pictures of parts should attempt to show the cause of Failure or the extent of the damage. A picture of the outside of a component will not help visually verify an internal part Failure.</p>
 
<p>Pictures should generally be taken as close as possible to the part to show detail.</p>
 
<p>Digital photo's should be sent to US as .PJG files, (They can also be mailed if necessary).</p>
 
<p><strong>Manufacturer's Warranty Period, Recalls, AND Product Improvements</strong></p>
 
<p>Our coverage begins the day after the Manufacturer's warranty expires. If a unit is still under factory coverage and a</p>
<p>Claim occurs, it must be filed with the Manufacturer.</p>
 
<p>If the Manufacturer's warranty period has expired and a Claim is covered by a Manufacturer recall or Product Support Program, the Claim must be filed with the Manufacturer. Our coverage will not apply in such an instance. If a Manufacturer's recall or Product Support Program only partially covers a Claim, the Claim may be submitted to US for review. We will require a full explanation of what the Manufacturer allowed along with a copy of the Manufacturer's settlement statement.</p>
 
<p><strong><u>Replacement versus Repair Cost</u></strong></p>
 
<p>We allow the use of exchange components under certain circumstances. The guidelines are as follows: The cost to repair the failed component meets or exceeds 70% of the value of a remanufactured or new exchange component. If the repair cost falls under 70%, the failed component should be repaired and WE will pay only for parts and labor associated with the actual failed parts. In an exchange unit WE will not pay for parts which have not failed, but due to normal wear and tear need to be replaced to bring the component back to new exchange specifications.</p>
 
 
<p><strong><u>Save the Old Parts, Fluids and Cores</u></strong></p>
 
<p>Save the Failed component and parts related to the Failure until the Claim is resolved. Occasionally WE may need to have parts sent to US. We will ask for these parts within 30 days of a Claim being received. We will return the parts as quickly as possible. If there is a rush to get the parts back, notify US and WE will ship the parts back to you within three business days of receiving them. Save involved/related compartment fluid samples until the Claim is resolved in case the samples are needed to determine the cause of the Failure. We may direct you to deliver a core for rebate/deposit or to reduce the cost of the Claim if the core has residual value.</p>
