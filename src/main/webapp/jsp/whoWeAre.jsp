        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
			<p>There is an extraordinary combination of unique and compatible strengths among the AgGuard management team.  Our leaders have shared values and a common skill for creating innovative solutions for complex problems that are customer-focused and delivered with unquestioned integrity. </p>
			
			<h3>BUSINESS DESCRIPTION</h3>
			<p>Founded in 2001, AgGuard provides risk management solutions primarily to the agricultural industry. The company's principal product is extended service contracts (ESCs) on farm machines that are sold through implement dealerships.  Such contracts are sometimes referred to as extended warranties or service plans.  The company does not sell directly to consumers, but has programs that are marketed through equipment manufacturers.  AgGuard was the first third party provider of ESCs for farm equipment.</p>
			
			<h3>OUR VALUES</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>We believe our mission is to provide great products that help folks sleep easier and focus on their work. </li>
				<li>We are constantly innovating; asking what if and why not?</li>
				<li>We believe in making the complex simple.</li>
				<li>We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies and delivery methods for our products, and participate only in markets where we can make a difference.</li>
				<li>We believe in deep relationships and collaboration with manufactures, dealers and the people using the equipment we cover-this people-based, relationship approach to business allows us to innovate and deliver in ways that others cannot.</li>
				<li>We will not settle for anything less than excellence in everything that we do.</li>
				<li>We listen and empathize with our customer-partners; we admit when we are wrong and we have the courage to change.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These values are embedded in our organization and everything we do-it is why we are the leading provider of extended service contracts to the agricultural industry</p>
		
			<h3>SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM</h3>
			<p><strong>Gregg Denholm, Principal</strong> (Founder and Chief Problem Solver)<br />Mr. Denholm is a self-proclaimed tractor geek.  Growing up on a farm near Tonganoxie, Kansas (about 30 minutes west of Kansas City) Gregg took an early interest in farm machinery. Taking hay balers apart to understand how they operated and rebuilding them to work more efficiently, he developed a life-long fascination.  He attended Kansas State University to study engineering and farm machinery. He started his career at the Heston Corporation in crop testing and product reliability where he helped create some of the company's most innovative haying equipment.  From there he went on to Doan Farm Management and began transferring his efficiency and innovation skills from machines to the overall management of the farm.  This move to management eventually led to banking, but Gregg has never lost his love of farming and his encyclopedic knowledge of farm machinery.  In 1992 he launched AgGuard as the first, third-party provider of extended service contracts for the agricultural industry, because he realized, as the cost and complexity of farm equipment increased, farmers needed greater risk protection.   At AgGuard, Gregg's primary responsibilities are product innovation, problem resolution and keeping us close to our roots to protect farmers from risk</p>
			<p><strong>Michael Jeannin, Senior Relationship Manager</strong><br />For many dealers Mike is the go-to source for information and help with pricing and service.  Mike grew-up on a farm and still lives in the country; he has spent his entire life working in various aspects of the agricultural industry, (dairy, row-crop farming, farm real estate, and ag-banking).  Since 2005 he has provided relationship management at AgGuard.  He is the opposite of the prototypical salesman.  He is a no-nonsense, straight-shooting fellow who is always the loudest advocate for our customer's needs.  He understands the perspective of our clients and provides a level of service and empathy that can't be duplicated by any call center.  His word is his bond and he is exactly the kind of face AgGuard wants on our products and services.</p>
			<p><strong>Dane Lee, Director of Administration</strong><br />Mr. Lee is an experienced business leader with over 20 years of experience in banking and public finance.  He has a passion for innovation and efficiency.  Lee is a two-time winner of Wells Fargo's Management Excellence award and has received numerous accolades for sales and service in banking and trust administration.  He is known for his integrity and putting the client at the center of everything he does.   Lee is a graduate of the University of Kansas and attended business school at Baker University with published research concerning environmental liability for trustees.   Mr. Lee is also President of Wild Jay, Inc., the entity that guarantees AgGuard's service contracts.  At AgGuard, he is responsible for the company's administrative affairs; acting as a liaison between Wild Jay, Inc. and our different functions, (i.e., relationship management, sales, claims, service and information technology).</p>
			<p><strong>Dexter Schaible, Director of Manufacturer Relationships</strong><br />Mr. Schaible is a well-known figure in the agricultural machinery industry for both his knowledge and integrity.  He is the former President of Soo Tractor, a company that provided contract manufacturing to original equipment manufacturers, where he was responsible for transforming the company and significantly growing its capacity before retiring in 2012.  Prior to joining Soo Tractor, he was a senior executive at AGCO responsible for numerous divisions in the USA and abroad.</br>Dexter is a graduate of Kansas State University.  Because of his deep experience in manufacturing, he is able to empathize with the needs of our manufacturing partners and provide them with innovative solutions.</p>
			<p><strong>Adrian Powell, Claims Director</strong><br />Since its inception, AgGuard has relied on Adrian's advice as our go-to guy in the industry for information on product reliability and technical services.</br>During his 30+ year career with Massey Ferguson and AGCO, he wrote the book on reliability and managed many of the industry's most innovative technical developments.</br>He led the design, development and global implementation team for AGCO "Source" (a contact and knowledge management system designed to document technical issues and share resolutions globally with technical service departments and dealers) and "EDT" (a common platform for diagnostic programs with auto update features, giving dealers one tool to perform diagnostics on all AGCO Equipment globally.)</br>Mr. Powell is a graduate of Hereford College of Technologies with a B Sc, in Agricultural Mechanization & Engineering. Leveraging his vast industry experience, he ensures that claims are processed with a thorough understanding of the product.  He and his claims team know how the machines are manufactured, why parts fail and the most cost-effective way to make repairs.  As a result, he manages a process that is fair; geared towards paying claims quickly and efficiently.  His team adds value to the claims service by providing dealers with expert service advice and access to fairly-priced parts.</p>
			<p><strong>John W. Mack, Jr., Chief Technology Officer (1964-2013)</strong><br />Mr. Mack led our programming team with the conviction that design elegance across all levels is the only thing that ultimately provides awe-inspiring functionality to a program.  John studied physics at Kansas State University, but his passion was always programming computers which he did ever since personal computing became commonplace.  He was the senior programmer for Lockton Risk Services and gave Ag Guard's in-house IT team the programming muscle that most companies outsource.  This capability allowed us to truly own our technology and gave us the capability to nimbly provide customized services and solutions to our clients.  His untimely death in 2013 leaves a big whole in our hearts, but his work lives on in our technology; his footprints will remain in our innovations for decades.  The "Dude" abides.</p>
			<p><strong>Paul Folsom, of counsel</strong><br />Much of AgGuard's success stems from its singular focus on the Agricultural industry, so we employee individuals who are subject matter experts in various aspects of the industry.  Mr. Folsom is a great example.  He has spent his entire career in various facets of agriculture: cattle, farming, commodities and most recently pharmaceuticals.  His broad experience and success in so many different aspects of the industry helps us stay in-tune with our unique and demanding market.  His business acumen also helps us keep our pencils sharp and priorities focused on how best to model our products and services to meet the needs of our clients.</p>
		
			<h3>THE NEW AGGUARD BUSINESS MODEL</h3>
			<p>Prior to January 1, 2012, AgGuard's services were administered by Glynn General and backed by various companies including Lloyds of London, ASI and AmTrust.  In the first six months of 2012, AgGuard suspended sales of new contracts and completely re-engineered its products and services.</p>
			<p>As of June 1, 2012, AgGuard entered into a relationship with Wild Jay, Inc. who now guarantees the payment of valid claims on contracts sold after June 1, 2012.</p>
			<p>The relationship with Wild Jay, Inc. represented a significant change in how we do business.  The owner's of Wild Jay, Inc. own a controlling interest in AgGuard and AgGuard owns an interest in Wild Jay, Inc.  This financial relationship brings our services into complete alignment and means our client's relationship with us will be seamless.  AgGuard will remain your advocate for claims processed through the old administrators, (Glynn General and Bridge Water), but we still cannot determine the outcome of any of those claims decisions.  Ultimately those decisions are made by the reinsurance providers, (Lloyds of London, ASI and AmTrust). </p>
			<p>It was a lack of control that led us to the development of this symbiotic relationship with Wild Jay, Inc.  Wild Jay, Inc. is not focused on profits from premiums or the price of your service contract; they instead reinvest the funds not paid out in claims to provide greater security and where-with-all for paying future claims.  They seek their profits from their investment in AgGuard and interest income on the reserves.  This structural change alone reduced the cost of our contracts by as much as 18%, while providing an efficient, one-step claims process that now measures the time between claims submission and payment in hours not weeks.</p>
			<p>Our business model gives us control of all aspects of the service we sell and provides our customers with direct access to both their sales manager and their claims manager. </p>
			<p>Imagine how excited we are with this innovative approach and the opportunity to make such a significant and positive change in the industry.  We know we can count on you for advice and counsel along the way so that we can continue to provide you with the best possible products and services.</p>
		
			
			<p><strong>Claims process:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Submit claim on AgGuard's webpage (Do not begin work prior to our approval of the claim) </li>
				<li>We will review your claim and contact you directly if we need any clarifications.  We may be able to provide you with service advice and parts sourcing to help expedite the repair.  Once we approve the repair, we will immediately make payment on the claim.</li>
				<li>Because our claims managers are experts on the machines that we cover, they can quickly assess the validity of a claim.  That makes them hard to fool with a bad claim, but they want to get any valid claim paid quickly.</li>
				<li>This is a one-step process with no middlemen to delay your payment.</li>
			</ul>
